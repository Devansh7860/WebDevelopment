                <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first
                    released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant
                    whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code
                    for small and large-scale projects</p>

                <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a
                    private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex
                    Web-based Internet applications (Web apps), electronic businesses, and social network services.It includes CSS, HTML and JAVASCRIPT.

                <p>C++  is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the
                    C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now
                    has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.It is
                    almost always implemented as a compiled language.
